# org.jw.jwlibrary.mobile-patch

Fixed version of jwlibrary.apk

Currently this repository remove default handlers from jwlibrary.apk, so it won't try to open files that it shouldn't, feel free to add more patches in the `parts` directory.

How to build it? Run `./patch.sh` everything will happen on it's own.

Don't want to build on your own? Fine - [grab the apk](https://github.com/MrCyjaneK/org.jw.jwlibrary.mobile-patch/releases/download/main/jwlibrary.apk)
